# USDS/CMS Onboarding

### Welcome!
Let's start with, we are so happy to have you here, you have no idea.  You will be a force of change that is so sorely needed.  I documented my first couple of weeks of onboarding and threw most things that I encountered here in hopes to help those that followed me can have the same questions I had addressed.  This is my first time in government work, so everything was brand new to me.

### Day 1 and 2 Orientation
Location of orientation will be at the [Centers of Medicare and Medicaid] (CMS) office in Baltimore.  If you are coming from DC, plan for at least an hour and half commute.  I took the MARC train from Union Station to Penn Station and then to West Baltimore my first couple of days.  Of course that included the final bus trip on the #40 from West Baltimore to the CMS office which you'll get different opinions depending on who you talk with if this is the best idea in terms of safety.  If you do take this ride, just be aware of your surroundings.

  - Try to stay awake and observe government culture.  See anything that needs fixing?!
  - Benefits  
    - [TSP information] Government 401k equivalent.
        - [TSP form] (matching is up to 5%)
    - [TSP rollover options]
    - [Health/Vision/Dental information for DC]. There are a lot!  I had analysis paralysis looking over this list.  I spent a good deal of time going through the whole list and the top three plans, in no particular order, that I landed on where the Blue Cross Blue Shield, Samba Nationwide, and GEHA (good DC plan).  You milage my vary though.

### Equipment and other things/information that you need
  - Your PIV Card.  This is pretty much your ID that you wear everywhere.  They actually ask you not to smile for your picture, so be ready for that...
  - Your EUA ID.  This four digit code is your CMS ID
  - Your EUA Password.  This is password is the bane of manys existance.  I believe that you'll have to update it once every 90 days.
  - Your email address.  In my case, I couldn't access my email for over a week...something about not having the correct job code.
  - CMS laptop.  This is a generic Dell PC.  I was able to pick mine up at HHS in DC.  I use this soley for email access.
  - iPhone.
  - Macbook.  I think this might be optional to some.  As a developer, I needed the tools to do my work so you might not need this.  CMS actually purchased this directly from the Apple store and had me go pick it up.

### After Orientation
For me, this was my main source of confusion.  Questions like: "Where do I go now?", "What am I doing?", "Exactly who is my manager?".  

Get ready to hop between locations multiple times a day.  This is very doable with the help of the Metro and Uber at times.  The main building that you'll be concerned with are:

  - [Centers of Medicare and Medicaid] (CMS) HQ in Baltimore.
  - [National Government Services] Office in Baltimore.  This is our workspace at CMS.
  - [Health and Human Services] (HHS) HQ in DC.  Humphrey Building.  We are in room 709d -- frankly, you'll have to ask someone how to get there because I still don't see much logic in how government organizes their room locations.
  - [Jackson Place] (JP) in DC.  This is pretty much homebase between USDS teams.  This building requires a password to get in at the door -- you'll have to inquire about this when you arrive.
  - [General Services Administration] (GSA) in DC on 1800 F Street.  Staff meeting location and other general meetings are had here.  Just a heads up, there are quite a few GSA buildings around the city.
