		* Defined release announcement strategy
	* Provided technical guidance, through a technical review log, for 7 contractors
	* Architectual design and guidance
	* Testing guidance
	* Devops guidance
	* Developed testing strategies for two independent testing teams that included setting up infrastructure to run test suites to defining test boundaries.
	* Major involvement with contracting.
		* Authored multiple Statement of Objectives
		* A voting member for six awarded contracts
		* Responsible for over $60MM of awarded contracts
	* Plan and ran meetings for different areas of development:

		* Shared Tooling (logging, http clients, scrubbing, etc)
			* Authored many shared tools (shared healthcheck)
			* Primary code reviewer
		* DevOps

**Impact**: The Quality Payment Program (QPP) Submissions API broke ground in software development at CMS. It was the first public transactional API in the history of quality reporting programs at CMS, and the first to be developed in the open. External partners participated in development through a public sandbox and a developer preview program. The Submissions API allows external partners to submit data to QPP on behalf of eligible participants in an entirely automated way that replaces manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone processes. It also offers new value in the form of real-time transactional feedback that lets submitters know where they stand. The QPP Submissions API automated thousands of manual transactions, saving external partners hundreds of hours of labor per participant. Over 200 external partners interacted with our APIs in the public sandbox, 129 (65%) participated in our developer preview, and 98 (49%) submitted hundreds of thousands of submissions with a 99% success rate. We have seen demo after demo of creative external user interfaces built on top of our APIs. To quote one external developer, “this is a quantum leap forward compared to what CMS has done before.”

Despite fears that QPP would become “the next healthcare.gov,” our incredible team built the service using open-source components, launched the platform before our required start date, maintained 100% uptime, and supported hundreds of vendors who submitted millions of API requests. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that our novel approach saved at least $100 million in implementation costs for QPP.

QPP received several awards, including the FedHealthIT Innovation Award and an API World Award. Our team also received the Execution of Major Projects Award at CMS

**Project Name**: Medicare Payment System Modernization  
**Project Description**: Positioning Medicare’s payment systems (that currently process over $500B in claims, roughly 3.5% of GDP) to allow for rapid adoption of new technologies and value-based payment models. Updating 30-50 year old systems to run in modern architectures that allow for large scalability, agile software development, and the contracting vehicle that allows for rapid procurement.  
**My Role**: Project Lead  
**Responsibilities**:
* **Project Leadership**
	* Wrote project proposal, set scope, built USDS team.
	* Developed project goals along with a short and long term vision/strategy
	* Aligned and organized CMS leadership into a governance board.
	* Executed Organizational and enterprise change management in approach to large project execution within the agency.
	* Acquired an initial $8MM in funding.
	* Designed and developed project contracting strategy.
	* Introduced new cloud environment into a legacy mainframe system.
	* Weekly one-on-ones with team members.
* **Team Leadership**
	* Introduced cloud environment into a legacy mainframe system
		* Positioned the mainframe to be a client to APIs in the new cloud environment.
		* Iterative and incremental migration of COBOL modules away from the mainframe environment to modern languages hosted in the cloud accessed through APIs.
	* Introduced agile software develoment in a waterfall process.
	* Overhauled testing strategies
		* Introduced automated unit and integration tests.
		* Involved CMS policy stakeholders into the testing process.

**Impact**: Positioning systems to scale infinitely with the flexibility of how CMS can process claims and pay providers allows for technology to be a multiplier for policy rather than an inhibitor. These systems will have the ability to adopt value-based models to pay for care which will shift the whole healthcare landscape in the US. This system is the single most important system in the determination of how healthcare will be provided in the US.

**Project Name**: USDS Headquarters  
**My Role**: Digital Service Expert  
**Responsibilities** 
* Resume reviews for future USDS members
* Multiple presentations during the staff USDS meetings on the progress of projects
* Lead a breakout session during staff meeting about Medicare Fraud
* Provided SRE and SWE oncall support during Healthcare.gov's 2018 Open Enrollment
* Involved in four, lead two, 2-4 week 'sprints' that later turned into USDS projects

**Impact**: Embodying USDS' values by directly participating in: "Hire and empower great people", "Find the truth. Tell the truth", "Optimize for results, not optics", "Go where the work is", and "Create momentum". USDS is the first federal agency whose mission is truly focused on transforming critical service through technology, rethinking how the government buys digital services, expanding the use of common platforms, services, and tools, and bringing top technical talent into public service.

USDS has had major impacts at different agencies such as the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, and the Small Business Administration. What starts initially as individual contribution on technology projects for these different agencies often turns into a larger change management approach when it comes to delivering digital services
